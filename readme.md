## A dumbly titled CSS framework

I've learned a lot since taking my first shot at building a [CSS framework](https://github.com/mattfelten/foreplay). This is take two.

### Goals
- Support making a project-specific pattern libraries quicker
- Mostly mixins, functions and a few helper classes
- Very little generated CSS
- Included components (layout, etc) should be devoid of style

### To Do
- [Figure out better name](https://twitter.com/codinghorror/status/506010907021828096)
- Documentation
- Split out project boilerplate into it's own repository?
- Turn into a npm/Bower package?
